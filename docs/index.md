# Maria Murad's GitHub Pages Site

Hi, I'm Maria! Welcome to my GitHub Pages site where I showcase my projects and a few of my varied interests. I am a current junior at SMU, triple majoring in Creative Computing, French, and Corporate Communication to hopefully become a coder for a French company one day. I love to stay active, whether it is by swimming or cycling, and love matcha!
