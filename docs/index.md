# Maria Murad's Site

Hi there, I'm Maria! Welcome to my GitHub Pages site, where I showcase my projects and a few of my varied interests. I am a junior at SMU, triple majoring in Creative Computing, French, and Corporate Communication & Public Affairs. I hope to either become a coder or lead an IT team for a French company one day. I love to stay active, whether it is by swimming or cycling, and I love matcha!
